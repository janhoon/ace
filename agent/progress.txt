## Current Sprint Started: 2026-02-09

Working on UX improvements and bug fixes.

## Task DASHBOARD-SETTINGS-001: Add dashboard settings page accessible while viewing dashboard - 2026-02-09T01:06:52Z
- What was done: Added an in-view Dashboard Settings modal from the dashboard toolbar, with editable name/description/default time range/refresh interval/variables for editors and read-only visibility for viewers; persisted view settings per dashboard in localStorage and applied time-range/refresh defaults immediately on save.
- Files changed: `frontend/src/components/DashboardSettingsModal.vue`, `frontend/src/views/DashboardDetailView.vue`, `frontend/src/views/DashboardDetailView.spec.ts`, `agent/prd.json`, `agent/progress.txt`
- Tests: failing (full frontend suite has pre-existing failures in `src/api/dashboards.spec.ts`, `src/components/CreateDashboardModal.spec.ts`, and `src/components/Panel.spec.ts`); passing (targeted touched-area: `npm run test -- src/views/DashboardDetailView.spec.ts`, plus `npm run type-check`)
- Browser validation: failing (required `dev-browser` skill unavailable in this environment; could not run real-browser flow validation)

## Task PERMISSIONS-FIX-001: Fix default dashboard permissions (401 error on new dashboards) - 2026-02-09T01:08:59Z
- What was done: Updated dashboard creation to run in a transaction and seed default dashboard ACL entries for all org members (view) with creator elevated to admin; added coverage verifying creator gets admin, org members get view, and default ACL entries are persisted.
- Files changed: `backend/internal/handlers/dashboards.go`, `backend/internal/handlers/permissions_test.go`, `agent/prd.json`, `agent/progress.txt`
- Tests: passing (`cd backend && go test ./...`)
