## Task UNFILED-DASHBOARDS-ROOT-001: Move unfiled dashboards to root level in explorer - 2026-02-09 10:12 UTC
- What was done: Removed the dedicated "Unfiled" tree node/section and rendered unfiled dashboards directly at root level in the explorer/main view alongside folders, while preserving drag/drop to root and existing dashboard interactions.
- Files changed: `frontend/src/components/DashboardList.vue`, `frontend/src/components/DashboardList.spec.ts`, `agent/prd.json`, `agent/progress.txt`
- Tests: failing (full frontend suite has pre-existing failures in `src/api/dashboards.spec.ts` and `src/components/Panel.spec.ts`), passing (targeted touched-area test `src/components/DashboardList.spec.ts`)
- Browser validation: failing (required `dev-browser` skill is unavailable in this environment; skill lookup returned "not found")
