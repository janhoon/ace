  - Implemented atomic ACL replacement using a transaction that clears and recreates entries per resource
  - Added validation to reject principals outside the resource organization for both `user` and `group` principal types
  - Added integration tests covering folder/dashboard ACL lifecycle, non-admin access denial, cross-org validation, and effective permission changes through authz resolution

- What was done:
  - Added a full Groups section to organization settings with list/create/rename/delete flows wired to the groups API module

  - Wired frontend dashboard update payloads to include `folder_id` and refreshed grouped dashboard sections after save
  - Extended backend dashboard model/handlers to read/write `folder_id` in list/get/update responses and enforce org-scoped folder validation on moves
  - Added request parsing support for explicit `folder_id: null` updates so moving dashboards back to root persists correctly
- Files changed:
  - frontend/src/components/EditDashboardModal.vue
  - frontend/src/components/EditDashboardModal.spec.ts
  - frontend/src/components/DashboardList.vue
