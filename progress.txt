## Task DASHBOARD-UI-TIMERANGE-001: Fix dashboard time range dropdown layering - 2026-02-09T13:17:57Z
- What was done:
  - Fixed dashboard header layering so the time range dropdown renders above panel content instead of behind it

## Task UX-EXPLORER-003: Remove duplicate explorer panes for Finder-only list - 2026-02-09T09:51:00Z
- What was done:
  - Consolidated dashboard navigation to a single visible Finder-style explorer pane
  - Added active path and context subtitle directly above the list so navigation context remains visible without a second content panel
  - Hid the duplicate center and preview panes to remove repeated folder/dashboard content and keep one navigation surface

  - progress.txt
- Tests: passing (`cd frontend && npm run type-check`, `cd frontend && npm run test -- src/components/DashboardList.spec.ts`)

  - Reworked the explorer tree so folders and dashboards are shown together in one hierarchy like a desktop file browser
  - Added nested dashboard rows under expanded folders (and under Unfiled), with single-click preview and double-click open
  - Kept folder-first navigation while improving scanability with mixed folder/file row styling and persistent subtree counts
- Files changed:
  - frontend/src/components/DashboardList.vue
  - progress.txt
- Tests: passing (`cd frontend && npm run type-check`, `cd frontend && npm run test -- src/components/DashboardList.spec.ts`)

## Task UX-EXPLORER-001: Simplify dashboard folder explorer navigation - 2026-02-09T09:44:10Z

  - Audited the existing dashboard explorer behavior with dev-browser against seeded nested folder data
  - Updated tree navigation to be easier to scan with explicit folder controls (expand all/collapse), stronger row states, and double-click expand behavior
  - Changed folder counts in the tree to reflect subtree totals so parent folders show meaningful numbers
  - Added selected-folder subfolder chips and clearer subtitle context to make folder traversal more intuitive
- Files changed:
  - frontend/src/components/DashboardList.vue
  - progress.txt
- Tests: passing (`cd frontend && npm run type-check`, `cd frontend && npm run test -- src/components/DashboardList.spec.ts`)

## Task SSO-FE-UI-002: Restructure SSO settings into configure flow - 2026-02-09T00:20:30Z
