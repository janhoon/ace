## Task FRONTEND-BIOME-001: Add Biome linting defaults for Vue frontend - 2026-02-09T14:10:07Z
- What was done:
  - Added Biome configuration for the frontend with Vue-friendly defaults (2-space indentation, single quotes, trailing commas, 100-column width)
  - Added frontend lint and formatting scripts (`lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`, `format:check`) while keeping `lint:dead-code`
  - Tuned rules for current Vue SFC ergonomics by disabling Biome unused-variable/import checks (covered by TS) and keeping `useImportType` as a warning to guide gradual cleanup
- Files changed:
  - frontend/biome.jsonc
  - frontend/package.json
  - frontend/package-lock.json
  - progress.txt
- Validation: passing (`cd frontend && npm run lint`, `cd frontend && npm run lint:dead-code`, `cd frontend && npm run type-check`)
- Browser validation: n/a (not run in this environment)

## Task DASHBOARD-SETTINGS-VIEW-001: Move dashboard settings to dedicated route view - 2026-02-09T13:40:05Z
- What was done:
  - Replaced dashboard settings modal launch with route navigation to `/dashboards/:id/settings/:section`
  - Added a new `DashboardSettingsView` that uses the org-settings-style secondary sidebar with `General`, `YAML Editor`, and role-gated `Permissions` sections
  - Preserved settings behaviors (save metadata/defaults, YAML edit/validate/save, Grafana replace, YAML export) and kept permissions editing flow via `DashboardPermissionsModal`
  - Added a dedicated view test suite for section routing/redirects/role gating and updated dashboard detail tests to assert navigation instead of modal behavior

## Task DASHBOARD-UI-TIMERANGE-001: Fix dashboard time range dropdown layering - 2026-02-09T13:17:57Z

  - Added an explicit stacking order on the dashboard header and grid container to avoid backdrop-filter stacking-context overlap
- Files changed:
  - frontend/src/views/DashboardDetailView.vue

- What was done:
  - Consolidated dashboard navigation to a single visible Finder-style explorer pane
  - Added active path and context subtitle directly above the list so navigation context remains visible without a second content panel
  - Hid the duplicate center and preview panes to remove repeated folder/dashboard content and keep one navigation surface

  - progress.txt
- Tests: passing (`cd frontend && npm run type-check`, `cd frontend && npm run test -- src/components/DashboardList.spec.ts`)

## Task UX-EXPLORER-002: Unify folders and dashboards into OS-style tree - 2026-02-09T09:48:35Z
- What was done:
  - Reworked the explorer tree so folders and dashboards are shown together in one hierarchy like a desktop file browser

  - progress.txt

  - Audited the existing dashboard explorer behavior with dev-browser against seeded nested folder data
  - Updated tree navigation to be easier to scan with explicit folder controls (expand all/collapse), stronger row states, and double-click expand behavior
  - Changed folder counts in the tree to reflect subtree totals so parent folders show meaningful numbers
  - Added selected-folder subfolder chips and clearer subtitle context to make folder traversal more intuitive
- Files changed:
  - frontend/src/components/DashboardList.vue
  - progress.txt
- Tests: passing (`cd frontend && npm run type-check`, `cd frontend && npm run test -- src/components/DashboardList.spec.ts`)
- Browser validation: passing (validated before/after explorer behavior with dev-browser on `http://localhost:5173/dashboards`)
