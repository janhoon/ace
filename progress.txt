- Files changed:
  - .github/workflows/lint.yml
  - .github/workflows/security.yml
  - .github/workflows/coverage.yml
  - progress.txt
- Validation: not run locally (workflow-config change)
- Browser validation: n/a (not run in this environment)

## Task SECURITY-LOCAL-002: Stabilize local security checks with patched Go runtime - 2026-02-09T14:52:00Z
- What was done:
  - Investigated `make security-local` failure and found `govulncheck` was using host Go `1.25.1`, producing known stdlib CVE findings fixed in newer patch releases
  - Updated `make security-local` to run `govulncheck` in a pinned Go `1.25.7` Docker container for deterministic patched-runtime scanning
  - Re-ran local security checks and verified both `govulncheck` and `gitleaks` pass

  - Makefile
  - README.md
  - progress.txt
- Validation: passing (`make security-local`)
- Browser validation: n/a (not run in this environment)
